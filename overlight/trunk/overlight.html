<h1>Overlight</h1>
<h2>A web UI</h2>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>Overlight is a user interface for websites. The idea is to display
    information on a page like normal, but to add a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasimode">quasimode</a> that shows parts
    of the page that can be manipulated. Choosing one of these parts pops up an
    arbitrary web application over top of the page, and when you're done
    changing the info, you close the app.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="overlight-pane"
       run="http://del.icio.us/">

    <h3>Usage</h3>

    <p>Overlight is enabled on this page, as the big green "Ready" at bottom left
    indicates. Here's how to test-drive it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Press and hold "Escape" to enter the Overlight quasimode.</li>
      <li>While in this quasimode, hit a number key or click a pane to launch an
      app to manage the info in that pane.</li>
      <li>After you're done with the app, click "Close" or hit "Escape" again.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

</div>

<div class="pane overlight-pane"
     run="http://www.flickr.com/">

<h3>Wiring</h3>
<p>Here's how to add Overlight to a web page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include MochiKit.js, overlight.js, and overlight.css</li>
  <li>Add the class "overlight-pane" to any element that should get its own
  overlay.</li>
  <li>Also add a "run" attribute to each such element, set to the URL of the
  app to load.</li>
  <li>Add an element with id "overlight-logout" to indicate that you are
  authenticated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>Overlight is a proof of concept (read: bug-ridden garbage). I wrote it in
August 2006, and I decided to publish it after talking to <a
href="http://www.pagodacms.org/">these guys</a>.</p>


<h3>Props</h3>

<p><a href="http://rchi.raskincenter.org/index.php?title=Archy_FAQ">Archy</a>
turned me on to quasimodes. Then I met <a
href="http://humanized.com/">Humanized</a>, who are commercializing Archy under
the name <a href="http://humanized.com/products/">Enso</a>. I wrote Overlight
after meeting them. I ended up <a
href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/01/humanized-launches-enso.html">beta-testing</a>
Enso, and I now use it regularly. Thanks for the inspiration guys!</p>
