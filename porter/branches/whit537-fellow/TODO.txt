0.4
=======================
tests!
help & docs!
build in fault-tolerance, no more proxy errors!
consider using ignore list so we can use etc/hosts for other things too


future
=======================
should we wrap Binder and Porter into one package, Cambridge?
    Fellow won't be on the same server, so we at least want that in a separate package
only work with lowercase domain names
^C should cancel the command if there is one, or exit the program otherwise
figure out how to deal with SSL, since we need it for svn
install properly with distutils
non-interactive mode
log ourselves
write a function to columnize domains ... should be lined up on the first dot from the right
be sure we work with weird paths, e.g., coming from cron
porter> test (?)
beef up stats


done - 0.2
=======================
ls -l
convert websites to aliases
validate input
capture ^C
also account for www
only store server:port in the actual db
factor out db path to config
get tests working from outside of site-packages
runalltests.py
README
license
use sample db in tests
write a sort function for domains
write dns module
backup data files before writing
ls --info
locate and fix double-up bug
fix paths for testing framework
still getting double-up bug :/
separate svn-managed porter from content (var/, htdocs/, cgi-bin/)
named.conf.frag -> named.porter.conf
inline help
removing a non-existent domain should get a message
reformat do_ls for 80-char width
1 domains
grace -> gremlin
output slave and master named.conf files
named frags go to /home/gremlin
don't keep backups of named.conf files
tease named mgmt out into a separate program called "Binder"
    so that we can have domains in DNS that don't point anywhere w/in zetaserver
    in other words, we negate the benefit of our "parked page" by dictating that all domains be explicitly registered in Porter
    also, separating the two would solve the TESM dilemma
tease named mgmt out into a separate program called "Binder"
    update README
    update tests
    update program itself
deal with orphans -- we have a domain record but there is no server (API may solve this)

done - 0.4
=======================
ls -s shows report on /etc/hosts
fit codenames back into the mix, somehow?
refactor ls into dict switch notation
it would be nice to be able to do ping from within porter
refactor add/rm to work with Fellow
tab complete available servers (from etc/hosts) and ports (from rpc to servers)
ls arg should affect all ls modes
