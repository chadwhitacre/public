0.2
=======================
we don't actually handle DNS for tesm.edu -- does it matter if we still have a record for them?


0.4
=======================
deal with orphans -- we have a domain record but there is no server (API may solve this)
only work with lowercase domain names
tab complete available servers (from etc/hosts) and ports (from rpc to servers)
build in fault-tolerance, no more proxy errors! put in a default "parked" page for orphans, from porter's Apache!
be sure we work with weird paths, e.g., coming from cron


future
=======================
inline help
install properly with distutils
non-interactive mode
log ourselves
write a function to columnize domains ... should be lined up on the first dot from the right
fit codenames back into the mix, somehow?
