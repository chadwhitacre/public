0.2
=======================
backup data files before writing

ls --info
write a function to columnize domains ... should be lined up on the first dot from the right
only work with lowercase domain names
deal with orphans
tab complete available servers (from etc/hosts) and ports (from rpc to servers)
fit codenames back into the mix, somehow?
we don't actually handle DNS for tesm.edu -- does it matter if we still have a record for them?
build in fault-tolerance, no more proxy errors! put in a default "parked" page for orphans, from porter's Apache!
factor out a test case(?)
