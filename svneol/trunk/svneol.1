.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar subcommand
.Op Ar -w
.Op Ar path
.\"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
When you set the 'svn:eol-style' property on a file in a Subversion repository,
.Xr svn 1
checks the line endings in that file for consistency. If the newlines are
inconsistent -- i.e., they are a mixture of Windows ('\er\en'), legacy Macintosh
('\er'), and/or Unix ('\en') newlines -- then an error is raised and the propset
fails. The file can still be forced into the repository, but then you have
broken data in your repo.

The solution is to clean up the newlines in your text files before trying to
commit them. This can be done for single files with a utility such as
.Xr dos2unix 1 .
.Nm
is a
.Xr python 1
program that makes the job easier for a whole tree of files.

.Nm
walks the tree rooted at
.Ar path
(which defaults to the current working directory) and does one of four things,
depending on
.Ar subcommand :
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.\"
.\"
.It Nm clean
cleans up the line endings in all text files; if the
.Ar -w
argument is provided then Windows newlines are used, otherwise Unix newlines are used
.\"
.\"
.It Nm confgen
prints a minimal
.Xr svn 1
configuration file with all file extensions and filenames without an extension
in an auto-props section, setting 'svn:eol-style' to 'native'.
.\"
.\"
.It Nm find
prints the paths of all text files
.It Nm find_dirty
prints the paths of all text files that would be changed if you ran 
.Nm clean
.El
.Pp

For
.Nm clean ,
.Nm find ,
and
.Nm find_dirty ,
the definition of a text file
is taken from the current user's
.Xr svn 1
configuration file, which is assumed to be at:
.\"
.\"
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Pa ~/.subversion/config
.Ed
.Pp

Text files are those with filenames matching any
.Xr glob 1
in the [auto-props] section for which the 'svn:eol-style' property is set. All
newlines in these files are standarized to Unix newlines by default, or to
Windows newlines if the
.Ar -w
argument is given.

Note that
.Ar path
does not have to be an
.Xr svn 1
working copy. In fact,
.Nm svneol Ns 's
primary use case is preparing a large, non-versioned tree for initial import
into a Subversion repository.

.Bd -literal
$ cd ~/FooProject/
$ svneol confgen > ~/.subversion/config
$ vi ~/.subversion/config # manually remove extensions for binary files
$ svneol find_dirty | less
\&... # assuage any paranoia that binary files will be broken
$ svneol clean
locating text files ...................... 952 found

.Bl -dash
.It
refactor for getopt/optparse
.It
add an argument: path to config file
.It
big enough that it could use some unit tests
.It
nice to have svneol count, output like svneol clean but w/o changing files
