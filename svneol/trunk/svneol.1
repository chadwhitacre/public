.Sh DESCRIPTION
When you set the 'svn:eol-style' property on a file in a Subversion repository,
.Xr svn 1
checks the line endings in that file for consistency. If the newlines are
inconsistent -- i.e., they are a mixture of Windows ('\er\en'), legacy Macintosh
('\er'), and/or Unix ('\en') newlines -- then an error is raised and the propset
fails. The file can still be forced into the repository, but then you have
broken data in your repo.

The solution is to clean up the newlines in your text files before trying to
commit them.
.Nm
is a
.Xr python 1
script that makes this cleanup easier by intelligently operating on an entire
tree of text files.

Specifically,
.Nm
walks the tree rooted at
.Pa ./
and cleans up the line endings in all text files.
The definition of a text file is taken from the current user's
.Xr svn 1
configuration file, which is assumed to be at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Pa ~/.subversion/config
.Ed
.Pp
Text files are those with filenames matching any glob in the [auto-props]
section for which the svn:eol-style property is set. All Windows and legacy
Macintosh newlines in these files are converted to Unix newlines.

Note that the tree does not have to be an
.Xr svn 1
working copy in order to be processed successfully.
