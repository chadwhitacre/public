TODO

add edit tab that is basically zopes.pt (domains.pt will be in another product!)

    we need to do work on the forms. it may not work to have it in a table row
    :(  cause we need to get username:password somehow, as well as skel and
    port. forms also need validation (password, confirm; constrain Zope names
    to acceptable Zope ids, etc.)

    implement rename (only have to change instance_home in 5 files [4 bin/
    scripts + zope.conf])

    implement filter/batch

    link instance name to instance page if Little Cheeze is present

    How cool would it be to query the zope socket or lock or pid or whatever to
    see if each zope is actually running? Then start, stop, restart ...

ZopeInstance.py -- obj representing zope instance

LittleCheeze.py -- obj to park in client Zopes to feed info to Big Cheeze

Make other product -- Apache DNS Manager



DONE

validate add/edit (make sure paths exist!)

get skel working

get replacements working

fix delete.gif
