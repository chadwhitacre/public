TODO

dns would stick a domain name in our dns server and map the domain's ip to our
jail's

apache takes the domain request and maps it to a certain zope instance via
ports

zopes

    manage_zopes/style_zopes

    refactor <<HTTP_PORT>>

    implement port_get

    put inituser in skel?

    implement edit (to rename we have to change instance_home in 4 bin/ scripts
    + zope.conf)

    implement filter/batch

    link instance name to instance page if Little Cheeze is present

    How cool would it be to query the zope socket or lock or pid or whatever to
    see if each zope is actually running? Then start, stop, restart ...

LittleCheeze.py -- obj to park in client Zopes to feed info to Big Cheeze
