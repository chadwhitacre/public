TODO

dns would stick a domain name in our dns server and map the domain's ip to our
jail's

apache takes the domain request and maps it to a certain zope instance via
ports


add edit tab that is basically zopes.pt (domains.pt will be in another product!)

    general design diff between zope and us: paradigm in which you can delete
    multiple obj at once, or the one in which you can delete one at once

    we need to do work on the forms. it may not work to have it in a table row
    :(  cause we need to get username:password somehow, as well as skel and
    port. forms also need validation (password, confirm; constrain Zope names
    to acceptable Zope ids, etc.) -- thinking about putting inituser in skel,
    and continuing to use Zope error handling for validation.

    implement rename (only have to change instance_home in 5 files [4 bin/
    scripts + zope.conf])

    implement filter/batch

    link instance name to instance page if Little Cheeze is present

    How cool would it be to query the zope socket or lock or pid or whatever to
    see if each zope is actually running? Then start, stop, restart ...

LittleCheeze.py -- obj to park in client Zopes to feed info to Big Cheeze




DONE

validate add/edit (make sure paths exist!)

get skel working

get replacements working

fix delete.gif
