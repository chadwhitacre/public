Steve's todo
------------------------------


Medium Priority (needed to make the project solid and polished)

    parked pages for domains without instances, using master instance

    update all of chad's copious documentation :-)

    confirm security settings

    stop and restart instances TTW

    stop and restart instances when we edit them

    instance delete/decommission settings

    tests/

    interfaces/


Low Priority (version 2)

    Little Cheeze -- object to feed info from slave instances to master



Chad's todo
------------------------------

validate port_range and port_list

refactor flow control on ports_list_available

mv props to config tab

zopes

    update filtering

    grey out port when |stock| is skelected

    put inituser in skel?

    implement batch

    link instance name to instance page if info is available

    How cool would it be to query the zope socket or lock or pid or whatever to
    see if each zope is actually running? Then start, stop, restart ...

include a default skel w/ package that works with port numbers
