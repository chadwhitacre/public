dns would stick a domain name in our dns server and map the domain's ip to our
jail's

apache takes the domain request and maps it to a certain zope instance via
ports

zopes

    implement ackawi8080 as instance name

    implement zope_edit

    grey out port when |stock| is skelected

    put inituser in skel?

    implement edit (to rename we have to change instance_home in 4 bin/ scripts
    + zope.conf)

    implement filter/batch

    link instance name to instance page if Little Cheeze is present

    How cool would it be to query the zope socket or lock or pid or whatever to
    see if each zope is actually running? Then start, stop, restart ...

LittleCheeze.py -- obj to park in client Zopes to feed info to Big Cheeze
