    <p>Cheap Zope instances are the foundation of efficient Zope hosting, both
    for development and production environments. Cheeze makes cheap Zopes a
    reality by providing TTW Zope instance management tools. 'Cheeze' stands for
    'Cheap Zope'.</p>

    <p>Using a Big Cheeze object, you can manage the following TTW:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Zope instances</li>
        <li>DNS</li>
        <li>virtual hosting with Apache</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Zopes</h2>
    <div class="toc">[ <a href="#toc">toc</a> ]</div>

    <p>There are two kinds of forms on the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a>
    tab: a form for adding new Zopes, and multiple forms for editing them.
    There are a couple gotchas wrt port numbers.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
        <span class="screenshot-label">Screenshot: Zopes table</span>
        <img src="image_zopes"
             alt="screenshot of zopes form" />
    </div>

    <h3>Add form</h3> <p>The green row is for adding new Zope instances; all
    fields are required. Name is not validated, but you will get an error if you
    use characters that are not legal for your filesystem. The dropdown shows
    the available skel on your system. (A skel is a Zope instance template). If
    you have not set the 'skel_root' property, or you set it to an empty
    directory, then this dropdown will not appear. Port must be an integer.</p>


    <h3>Edit forms</h3>

    <p>Each other row is a form for editing the name and port number for your
    existing Zope instances. Name and port are validated as for the 'add' form.
    Use the 'disk' icon <span style="whitespace: nowrap">( <img src="image_save"
    alt="disk icon" title="save" /> )</span> to save your new values. Use the
    'trash' icon <span style="whitespace: nowrap;">( <img src="image_delete"
    alt="disk icon" title="save" /> )</span> to delete the Zope instance. It
    will be completely deleted from your filesystem.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> It is up to you to turn off your Zope instance before you
    edit or delete it here. This is a UI shortcoming that is too expensive to
    fix at the moment.</p>


    <h3>Regarding Port Numbers</h3>

    <p>Note that in both kinds of forms 'Port' is only meaningful if that
    instance's zope.conf is configured properly. NB: the zope.conf in the skel
    that comes with Zope ('zope stock' in the list) is <b>not</b> configured
    properly. If you use that skel then the real port number for the instance
    will be 8080 no matter what you enter in the form. If that is the only
    skel available, then the 'Port' column is not shown. This is another UI
    shortcoming that is too expensive to fix at the moment.</p>
