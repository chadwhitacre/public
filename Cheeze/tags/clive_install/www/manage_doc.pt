        Intro
    </h2>

    <p>Cheap Zope instances are the foundation of efficient Zope hosting, both
    for development and production environments. Cheeze makes cheap Zopes a
    reality by providing TTW tools for making Zopes and paving roads to
    them.</p>

    <p>Using a Big Cheeze object, you can manage the following TTW:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Zope instances</li>
        <li>DNS</li>
        <li>virtual hosting with Apache</li>
    </ul>


    <a name="zopes"></a>
    <h2>
        <span class="toc_jump">[ <a href="#toc_jump">toc</a> ]</span>
        Zopes
    </h2>
    <p>There are two kinds of forms on the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a>
    tab: a form for adding new Zopes, and multiple forms for editing them.
    There are a couple gotchas with regard to port numbers.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
        <span class="screenshot-label">Screenshot: <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> table</span>
        <img src="image_zopes"
             alt="screenshot of zopes form" />
    </div>

    <h3>Add form</h3> <p>The green row is for adding new Zope instances; all
    fields are required. Name is not validated, but you will get an error if you
    use characters that are not legal for your filesystem. The dropdown shows
    the available skel on your system. (A skel is a Zope instance template). If
    you have not set the 'skel_root' property, or you set it to an empty
    directory, then this dropdown will not appear. Port must be an integer.</p>


    <h3>Edit forms</h3>

    <p>Each other row is a form for editing the name and port number for your
    existing Zope instances. Name and port are validated as for the 'add' form.
    Use the 'disk' icon <span style="whitespace: nowrap">( <img src="image_save"
    alt="disk icon" title="save" /> )</span> to save your new values. Use the
    'trash' icon <span style="whitespace: nowrap;">( <img src="image_delete"
    alt="disk icon" title="save" /> )</span> to delete the Zope instance. It
    will be completely deleted from your filesystem.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> It is up to you to turn off your Zope instance before you
    edit or delete it here. This is a UI shortcoming that is too expensive to
    fix at the moment.</p>


    <h3>Regarding Port Numbers</h3>

    <p>Note that in both kinds of forms 'Port' is only meaningful if that
    instance's zope.conf is configured properly. NB: the zope.conf in the skel
    that comes with Zope ('zope stock' in the list) is <b>not</b> configured
    properly. If you use that skel then the real port number for the instance
    will be 8080 no matter what you enter in the form. If that is the only
    skel available, then the 'Port' column is not shown. This is another UI
    shortcoming that is too expensive to fix at the moment.</p>


    <a name="domains"></a>
    <h2>
        <span class="toc_jump">[ <a href="#toc_jump">toc</a> ]</span>
        Domains
    </h2>

    <p>The <a href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab allows you to do the
    following:</p>

    <ul>

        <li class="not-yet">All domains entered on this page are entered in the
        server's
        DNS. It is assumed that the DNS file you point to in properties is
        being propagated out to the Net.</li>

        <li>You can map domain names to Zopes. This hits Apache vhosting.</li>

        <li>Domains that point at the same Zope are considered aliases; these
        are noted on this page for convenience.</li>

        <li class="not-yet">Delete always removes the domain from both DNS and Apache</li>

        <li>Domains that don't point to a Zope are pointed at a parking lot
        zope. Prolly just use master?</li>

    </ul>


    <a name="config"></a>
    <h2>
        <span class="toc_jump">[ <a href="#toc_jump">toc</a> ]</span>
        Configuration
    </h2>

    <p>Big Cheeze objects have six properties, which are all optional.
    Functionality is gracefully degraded if a given property is left blank. This
    flexibility allows Cheeze to be used in a variety of hosting situations.</p>


    <h3>instance_root</h3>

    <p>This is a path to a directory containing Zope instances (it is up to you
    to make sure that the directory only contains Zope instances). If it is
    present, then you will be able to use the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a>
    tab to create, delete, and edit Zope instances. This property also enables
    the 'Zope' column on the <a href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab. If it is
    not present, the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab will be blank, and the
    <a href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab will show the 'IP Address' column
    instead. This property overrides <b>address_list</b>.</p>


    <h3>skel_root</h3>

    <p>This is the path to the directory where your skel reside. If present, and
    the directory is not empty, then the add form on the <a
    href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab will include a skel dropdown and a 'Port'
    column. It is up to you to make sure that the directory only contains Zope
    skel.</p>


    <a name="vhost_db"></a>
    <h3>vhost_db</h3>

    <p>This is the path to your Apache vhost dbm. If this property points to a
    valid dbm file, then you will be able to use the <a
    href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab, and the 'Port' column on the <a
    href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab will display select boxes. If not present,
    then the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab will show text boxes in the
    'Port' column. If neither this property nor <b>dns_file</b> are present,
    then the <a href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab will be blank.</p>


    <div class="not-yet">
    <h3>dns_file</h3>

    <p>This is the path to your DNS file. If present, then changes on the <a
    href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab will propogate to this file. If
    neither this property nor <b>vhost_db</b> are present, then the <a
    href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab will be blank.</p>
    </div>

    <a name="port_range"></a>
    <h3>port_range</h3>

    <p>This property controls the input of port numbers on the <a
    href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab. If you enter a tuple with 2 or 3 items,
    these will be passed as arguments to python's <a
    href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/built-in-funcs.html"
    target="_blank">range()</a> function to generate a list of acceptable port
    numbers. You may also enter a list of integers directly. Other types of
    input will throw an exception. Once all of the available ports are used,
    Zope creation and port assignment will be disabled. If this property is left
    blank, then the <a href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab will allow arbitrary
    integers to be entered for port numbers.</p>


    <div class="not-yet">
    <h3>address_list</h3>

    <p>This property allows you to define a list of IP addresses to be used on
    the <a href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab. This property only applies
    when <b>instance_root</b> is blank. If both are blank, then both the <a
    href="manage_zopes">Zopes</a> tab and the <a
    href="manage_domains">Domains</a> tab will be blank.</p>
