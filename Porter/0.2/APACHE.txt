    APACHE CONFIGURATION
========================================

Porter expects that httpd will do the actual routing of http requests to the
appropriate backend server. The two interface via a dbm file at
$PKG_HOME/var/rewrite.db, which maps domain name to server:port. The intention
is that this file be used in a dbm RewriteMap. For details on dbm RewriteMaps
see Apache's documentation:

    Apache 1.3 -- http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMap

    Apache 2.0 -- http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap

Apache 2 supports four dbm types -- sdbm, ndbm, gdbm, and db. The default is
sdbm, which doesn't have a Python library afaict. We are using Python's dbm
module, which produces ndbm-compatible files. However, I couldn't get Apache
2.0.52 to compile --with-ndbm. I therefore dropped back to Apache 1.3.33 because
ndbm is in fact the only available type in 1.3.

The specific RewriteRule will need to be tailored to the backend server, but
here's the basic idea:

    <VirtualHost *>
        ServerAlias *
        RewriteMap  PorterMap dbm:$PKG_HOME/var/rewrite.db
        RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://${PorterMap:%{HTTP_HOST}}/$1 [L,P]
    </VirtualHost>



========================================
    ERRORS
========================================

There are three error conditions that can arise:

    1) We don't know about the domain at all. This is handled by the first vhost
    and a "parked" page.

    2) The backend server is down. To handle this we have three options:

        a. Maintain a custom "proxy error" page on this server that is at least
        not as ugly. LIKELY BEST OPTION

        b. Make porter smart enough to remove or withhold domains with downed
        servers (would mean proactively monitoring the servers). Porter needs to
        be dumb, imo. If we start making it smart then we need to look into
        Pound.

        c. Somehow handle it on the server end, so that there is a fallback or
        something.

    3) The hostname of the proxy server is wrong in porter. So if we are trying
    to point example.com to notthere:8080 then we will get a Proxy Error,
    Reason: Host not found (after a timeout period). This will eventually be
    mitigated by constraining addable domains/ports in porter, but for now we
    will just have to be careful. ;-)
