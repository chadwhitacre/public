0.2
=======================
reformat do_ls for 80-char width


0.4
=======================
deal with orphans -- we have a domain record but there is no server (API may solve this)
only work with lowercase domain names
tab complete available servers (from etc/hosts) and ports (from rpc to servers)
build in fault-tolerance, no more proxy errors! put in a default "parked" page for orphans, from porter's Apache!
figure out how to deal with SSL, since we need it for svn


future
=======================
install properly with distutils
non-interactive mode
log ourselves
write a function to columnize domains ... should be lined up on the first dot from the right
fit codenames back into the mix, somehow?
be sure we work with weird paths, e.g., coming from cron
porter> test (?)


done - 0.2
=======================
ls -l
convert websites to aliases
validate input
capture ^C
also account for www
only store server:port in the actual db
factor out db path to config
get tests working from outside of site-packages
runalltests.py
README
license
use sample db in tests
write a sort function for domains
write dns module
backup data files before writing
ls --info
locate and fix double-up bug
fix paths for testing framework
still getting double-up bug :/
separate svn-managed porter from content (var/, htdocs/, cgi-bin/)
named.conf.frag -> named.porter.conf
inline help
removing a non-existent domain should get a message
