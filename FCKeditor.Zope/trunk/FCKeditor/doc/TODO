packaging
    decide on license (see README.stx)
        prolly do want to include with every file, since we are advocating cut/paste
        FCKeditor is LGPL, so prolly use that (I expect I have to)
    release 0.9.0 -- first development release
    === DONE ===
    replace hasattr with getattr
    store FCKeditor proper in a separate svn repo/project - no; cause we want this in the collective
        include FCKeditor via svn:externals - no
    prolly drop CPS skin
    QI skins in reverse order
plone -- wysiwyg_support
    === DONE ===
    needs to support different storage formats (html, plain, stx)
    be smarter about showing format options or not
    tabindex
    === POSTPONED ===
    inserts extra paragraphs at beginning
    stylesheets?
    styles.xml?
    text vs. cooked_text?
    needs to play nice with other editors (epoz, kupu, etc.)
