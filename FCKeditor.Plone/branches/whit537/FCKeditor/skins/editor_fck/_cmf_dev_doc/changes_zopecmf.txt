Changes in FCK 2.0 FC-Preview for Plone/CMF integration :


1. The folder skins is renamed fck_skins because 'skins' is reserved in Zope CMF

2. Change file fckconfig.js  (line 29 for skinPath)

3. Change fonts in fckconfig.js

4. Change all files in ".html" as ".html.html" .

5. Added wysiwyg_support files (CMF template) for CMF integration

6. Added CMF/plone installation files at product root

7. Move all files in folder skins/editor_fck/ for CMF product integration

8. Added default basepath in fckconfig.js

9. Customization of toolbars in fckconfig.js

10. Added link to BrowseLink and BrowseImage in fckconfig.js

11. Added dtml and scripts python for browseLinks and BrowseImages

12. Rename fckstyles.xml in fckstyles.xml.pt for Zope compatibility

13. Added a .metadata file for each file (for Zope HttpCache) with vbs script (routine_for_zope_files.vbs)

14. Since Zope 2.7.2 Zope doesn't accept anymore "</" in javascript strings inside html files, for example we must change '</div>' in '<'+ '/div>'
    Très chiant de vérifier tout ça - j'arrive pas à faire une routine propre > please Frederico can you change these files

For the future :

    I will add an XML connector (ZPT xml) and i'll use fck browse interface . I
    can't do that immediately because in Zope, files and folders don't exist,
    all elements are objects which contain a lot of information and, for
    example, file extensions are not important in Zope ... i need to think about
    it, very interesting.
