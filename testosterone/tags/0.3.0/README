Pytest is a testing interpreter for Python.

Unlike a testing /framework/, pytest requires nothing of its test scripts that
is not included in the Python language itself. Pytests are regular Python
scripts that are interpreted in a special way. Specifically, all explicit
comparison statements (i.e., those with a comparison operator), are interpreted
as tests, and their results are tallied and reported on following execution of
the script.
