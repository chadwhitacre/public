subclass ServerProxy to use API key
in server, protext against calling respond via XMLRPC
=====DONE=====
best message transfer method: newline-delimited or Content-Length
    you want to buffer the read
    when you read 8192 and you only get 4096, what happens? do you have access to any newline?
    does readline require unbuffered?
    apparently not, cause readline in socket.py seems support this
    answer: newline-delimited!
establish connection
STOP
data should be stored encrypted
    uuid -v4 gives a 32 byte string, not counting the dashes
    this can be used for the AES key
    the smapd server must have clear data in order to index it
    having the crypt key differ from the client id would be stronger
        but realistically, think of the ways someone will steal your client id
            gaining access to your calling program
            you are unlikely to store it somewhere as you would a password,
                because you only ever wire it into a program
            unless they intercept an email in which it is revealed
            or if we display it on a website
                then we have cache issues (public terminals)
                etc.
    if a bank wants to run our software, they can buy a hosted solution
    for now, crypt key == client id
STOR
validate client ids at some early stage
    use as crypt key requires that they be 32 bytes w/o dashes
need to be able to get back to reproduce index from data alone
    to do this we need both the client ID and the crypt key on the server
    storing the client key on the server is fine, but not the crypt key
    so ... store messages in subdirectories named after the client id
    then the message id can be a straight hash the message, id not needed
    but then we lose the flexibility of storing messages on random servers
    why? no we don't
factor out common client/server code into a utils module (e.g. _wrap/_unwrap)
return '1 <msg id>' on AlreadyStored for verification
add indexing support to STOR
HDRS
RTRV
RMV -- need a RMV command to remove a message
improve error handling in TCPServer537 -- croaks on critical errors
    this actually belongs in smapd
FIND
think about case preserving/matching for headers
convert API from RTRV -> retrieve
added ALL and GET
convert to httpy + postgresql
