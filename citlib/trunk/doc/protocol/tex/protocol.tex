\noindent


This is an attempt to document the application layer protocol used by the
Citadel system, beginning with version 4.00, which is the first version to
implement a client/server paradigm.  It is intended as a resource for
programmers who intend to develop their own Citadel clients, but it may have
other uses as well.
