The unittests for citlib require a Citadel server that they can connect to, with
a single user, test, password testing, user level 6. This user will be used to
scrub the rest of the Citadel server at the beginning of each test. So you
really don't want to run these tests against a live citadel server. :-)

This functionality is in TestCaseCitlib. The only tests that don't use this test
case are test_CitConn_basic.py, which test the basic functionality of connecting
to and logging into a citadel server.
