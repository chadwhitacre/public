We've got two parts to this thing:

    Config -- manage the configuration

        I'm only going to support starting aspen in the root of the site you
        want to serve. And the config file is only going to be in one place:
        __/aspen.conf. No command line option for using a different conf file.

        defaults
        command line options
        configuration file
        envvars

    Website



to add filters based on mimetype
    if response.headers['Content-Type'].startswith('text/html'):
        foo
    to register custom extensions w/ mimetypes, use mimetype.add_type in a
    startup filter


can we access the last traceback from a exception filter?
