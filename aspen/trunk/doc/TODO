load rules/handlers/apps/middleware from setuptools entry points
    first, change the existing object nomenclature to that of setuptools (mod:obj)
    in a future version, add optional entry_point support when setuptools is installed
        that is, where object names are called for, entry point names can
          also be used
            if the name has a : in it, it is taken to be a specify a module directly
            if the name doesn't have a :, it is taken to be an entry point name

        config file includes?
        different config files for each mode?
            aspen.staging.conf
        or maybe one section per mode?

    rejected
        hostname -- take care of this elsewhere
        server identification -- we hardwire it
        access log format/filename/rotation -- pick a convention
        error log filename/rotation -- pick a convention
