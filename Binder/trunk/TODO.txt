=======================


future
=======================
install properly with distutils
non-interactive mode
log ourselves
write a function to columnize domains ... should be lined up on the first dot from the right
be sure we work with weird paths, e.g., coming from cron
binder> test (?)


done - 0.2
=======================
tease named mgmt out into a separate program called "Binder"
    so that we can have domains in DNS that don't point anywhere w/in zetaserver
    in other words, we negate the benefit of our "parked page" by dictating that all domains be explicitly registered in Porter
    also, separating the two would solve the TESM dilemma
um, dude, we don't want 'www.' in named.conf!
in fact, we don't want anything besides second-level domains in there.
    i.e., we want example.com, but not sub1.example.com
we may not even want to make www implicit in rewrite
