\chapter{Package Contents/API \label{api}}

The \module{httpy} package defines classes to represent HTTP Request and
Response messages. It also defines interfaces specifying how to build responders
and couplers, specimens of which are to be found in the \module{responders} and
\module{couplers} subpackages. Finally, the \class{mode} singleton provides an
object-oriented API for the \envvar{HTTPY_MODE} environment variable, and the
\module{utils} subpackage collects some other possibly useful utilities.



\begin{classdesc}{Request}{IRequest}
Constructs a new \class{Request} object. \var{IRequest} is a (probably implicit)
provider of the \class{IRequest} interface. This provision is validated, and the
desired API is transferred from the \class{IRequest} provider to the new object
instance.

Your responder's \method{respond} method will be given instances of this class,
so you will be using it constantly on that basis. However, you would probably
only need to instantiate it directly if you were writing a new coupler.
\end{classdesc}



\begin{classdesc}{Response}{\optional{code} \optional{, body} \optional{,
    headers}}
Constructs a new \class{Response} object. If given, \var{code} must be
an integer; the default is
\ulink{200}{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.2.1}
(see \citetitle[http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html]{the HTTP
spec} for other values that will be meaningful to most HTTP clients). \var{body}
may be a string, an iterator over strings, or an \class{httpy.utils.Path}
object. \var{headers} must be a dictionary.

\var{body} is second rather than \var{headers} because one more often wants to
specify a body without headers than vice versa. Also note that
\mailheader{Content-Type} defaults to \code{text/html} for responses where
\var{code} is between 200 and 299, inclusive, but to \code{text/plain} for
non-2xx responses.

This class is likewise central to \module{httpy} programming: its instances are
the payload for \module{httpy}'s overloaded \code{raise} statement. These will
be caught, validated, flattened, and sent out to the wire by whatever coupler is
in use.
