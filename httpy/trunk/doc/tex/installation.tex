\chapter{Installation}

On a \UNIX-derived system, install \module{httpy} with the following procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
$ fetch http://www.zetadev.com/software/httpy/latest/httpy.tbz
$ tar jxf httpy.tbz
$ cd httpy-x.x
$ make install
\end{verbatim}

This will install the \module{httpy} package into your system's Python, and will
install the executable and manual page under /usr/local. To use a specific
Python installation, change the installation location, or otherwise configure
the installation, please edit the Makefile.

To only install the Python package, use:

\begin{verbatim}
$ python setup.py install
\end{verbatim}

In particular, Windows users are currently limited to this method, because I
haven't yet found a good way to install an executable on Windows. I am open to
suggestions.
