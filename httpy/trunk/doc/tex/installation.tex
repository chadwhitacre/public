\chapter{Installation}

On a \UNIX-derived system, install httpy with the following procedure:

\begin{verbatim}
% fetch http://www.zetadev.com/software/httpy/0.3/httpy-0.3.tbz
% tar jxf httpy-0.3.tbz
% cd httpy-0.3
% make install
\end{verbatim}

This will install the httpy package into your system's python, and will install
the executable and manual page under /usr/local. To use a specific python
installation, change the installation location, or otherwise configure the
installation, edit the Makefile.

To only install the python package, use:

\begin{verbatim}
% python setup.py install
\end{verbatim}

In particular, Windows users are currently limited to this method, because I
haven't yet found a good way to install an executable on Windows. I am open to
suggestions.
