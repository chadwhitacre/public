\section{Couplers \label{couplers}}

\module{httpy} includes three couplers out of the box. I think couplers are
boring, but you might get a kick out of them. There are multiple Python
webservers available, and a couple FastCGI options too. I've tried to pick the
single most mature option in each category, and build the couplers on top of
those. If better options become available, I will switch.
