\section{Responders \label{responders}}

\module{httpy} includes three responders out of the box. The fun of
\module{httpy}, though, is in writing your own responders.

\begin{classdesc}{Static}{\optional{root}\optional{, defaults}} Constructs a new
\class{Static} responder object. \var{root} is the filesystem path of the
directory to use as the publishing root. If not given or \class{None}, then the
value in the class attribute of the same name is used if it does not evaluate to
\class{False}. If it does (and out of the box, it does), then \var{root} is set
to the current working directory. If \var{root} does not point to a directory,
\exception {ValueError} is raised. \var{defaults} is a sequence of names to use
when looking for a default resource. If it is omitted or \class{None}, it is set
to \code{('index.html', 'index.htm')}, after checking the class attribute as
with \var{root}. \end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{Multiple}{\optional{root}} Constructs a new \class{Multiple}
responder object. \var{root} has the same meaning as in
\class{Static}.\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc*}{XMLRPC}
The XMLRPC responder is not designed to be instantiated directly, but rather
used as a mixin.
\end{classdesc*}
