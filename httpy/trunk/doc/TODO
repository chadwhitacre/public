========================================
    0.6 -- zope.server
========================================
finish docs
man page
test our processing of different cases of configuration options
do we want traditional access logging? separate access and error logs?
when restarting in the middle of pdb, terminal gets screwed up
should allow any method
parse post to dict
remove __init__ requirement (don't always want to configure)
reconsider naming of Transaction given its meaning in persistence contexts
raise Response(537, {}) should give '{}', not '<empty>'
=====DONE=====
document apps
tests
make apps implicit rather than explicit
    change Config to auto-find apps by default -- can still be overriden
    also update Config tests to reflect the change
    shouldn't need to touch Server or Task since their input won't change
httpy.app.CGIMixin
supporting on-the-fly reloading of apps in dev mode
need to figure out how to sanely provide for alternate py libs
    answer: PYTHONPATH per daemontools -- configurable per site
    per-site lib
    per-app lib
    sys.path is not a simple solution since we have multiple apps -- what is the import order?
unittests!
refactor docs in Python style



========================================
    0.8 -- HTTP/1.1
========================================
keep-alive
range requests
=====DONE=====
transfer encoding


========================================
    1.0 -- BELLS & WHISTLES
========================================
precompile templates (in place)
    httpy -f httpy.conf -c
support interactive features:
    ctrl-s? -- display configuration settings
    ctrl-d? -- enter postmortem debugger on next exception
signal handling
    TERM -- nice shutdown
    HUP -- reload config
add cli options to dump config and exit
smarter module caching?



========================================
    1.2 -- EXPAND OUR TERRITORY
========================================
play nice on Windows
    GUI?
    pyexe?
















========================================
    0.2 -- STATIC
========================================
=====DONE=====
sensible error handling
get frame macro instead of template
configuration
    think through relationship of cli options, config, and env variables
        defaults -- can start httpy with no options, etc. and get something
    check to make sure site root exists on filesystem
    push all config checking up and out of init
write a make file
continue with unit tests
refactor into multiple modules, distutils + make
if frame.pt is empty, then frame should just be none
handle 500 better
400 -> 501
test error templates
ignore empty error template
test last resort
put tracebacks in error messages when in development mode
figure out daemontools


========================================
    0.4 -- DYNAMIC
========================================
=====DONE=====
write html docs
support something sane like CGI to provide context.py with it's API
manage sessions, post, querystring, cookies?
logging -- stdout :-) -- but support different verbosities
factor out medusa goofiness if possible
refactor for BaseHTTPServer -- no non-std lib dependencies!
separate error for each HTTP error? if not then why Redirect sep?
500 traceback should be in pre -- hardwire this into the message?
    the problem is that we also use message for redirects, which we don't
      necessarily want in pre, but on another level it doesn't matter cause
      noone ever sees that payload
factor out templating
need to import rather than execfile
    guessing its faster
    need persistence, e.g. for template caching
        import app rather than from app import Transaction
        then app.py can run whatever and it stays in memory
add apps to configuration
guess content type in response --> NO!!!!!!11
server string -> httpy
