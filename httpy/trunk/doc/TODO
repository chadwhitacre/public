Notes

I don't care what language httpy is written in, or if it is compiled or
interpreted. I am much more concerned about:

    the API it exposes to the site developer
    ease of installation (on Win though?)
    speed/robustness



0.2
==========
add app_paths and dev_mode to configuration
document app_paths and dev_mode
factor out medusa goofiness if possible
solidify and document the API -- this will have to be backwards-compatible!
mention daemontools for robust daemonization & logging
convert doc to man page
make file
unit tests
setup.py?



0.4
==========
sensible error handling
