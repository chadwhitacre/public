programmatic interface
    sendfile/GPL-free package
    httpy.couple(responder) -- automatically switches between CGI/FastCGI/StandAlone
        need to find a way to infer FastCGI env

tests
    write a restarting test loader/runner


    update tests post-refactor

    Request
    Response
    deliver -- only have with make_deliver
    couplers
        StandAlone
            ZopeRequest
            Config
        CGI
            CGIRequest
        FastCGI
    responders
        Multiple
        Static
        XMLRPC
    utils
        translate
        mode
        add_api
        couple


    Request and deliver need the most testing because the are the most
    complicated; that's where the action is. The couplers also need to be well

    test AF_UNIX in Server as well as in Config
    tests for utils.parse*
    run tests on Mac
    test Task when respond doesn't raise anything

documentation
    add intro paragraph to request.tex
    responders
            figure out what is up with responder.uri and .root
        Multiple
    couplers
        CGI
        FastCGI
        StandAlone
        custom
    man httpy(1)
    fix index for PDF; consider adding index to HTML; cross.linking (utils.Path)

logging
    access to stdout, error to stderr
    check out Apache Common Log Format
    needs to log to stderr instead of stdout?
    log should include file and line number
    log should take an expression that is only evaluated if needed
    it would be super cool to change the log level on the fly while running
        I would want to support this in all modes, including deployment
    also would be great to throttle logging to a single subsystem
    mimefs_logger
    config!
    how about a custom logger ...
        devel, debug, stage, deploy instead of info, warn, etc.
        simple on/off switch in Config

when restarting in the middle of pdb, terminal gets screwed up -- hrm
    see Server.RestartingServer.stop_child and TestCaseRestartingServer.py
    why can't we manage this in the signal handler? i.e., "if pdb: finish_pdb()"
        hrm, tried this; not instantly obvious
    maybe curses has an answer?
        http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/curses/curses.html
RestartingServer ends up in infinite loop in some cases (removing files under its watch?)
RestartingServer seems to miss _foo.py

tweaks
    raise Response(537, {}) -> error!
    why can't we just import StatusCodes from BaseHTTPServer?



========================================
    FUTURE
========================================
tighten up
    HTTP/1.0 -> HTTP/1.1
    charsets? unicode? i18n?
    keep-alive
    range requests
    chunked encoding
    100 Continue
support interactive features, e.g.:
    ctrl-s -- display configuration settings
    ctrl-d -- toggle postmortem debugging
    ctrl-v -- set verbosity on the fly
AJAX debugger? combine development and debugging modes
    or keep debugging mode as is and add ajax debugging in dev mode -- "dynamic traceback"
add cli options to dump config and exit
play nice on Windows
    GUI?
    pyexe?
Response.headers = [()] or {} -- not now!
Response.code = 200 or (200, 'OK') -- now now!
consider eggs for pluggability
should do smart things with large POST bodies, similar to outbound
ideally we wouldn't have to subclass static.App in order to use serve_static
think about how serve_* should work, re: reuse


========================================
    0.2 -- STATIC
========================================
=====DONE=====
sensible error handling
get frame macro instead of template
configuration
    think through relationship of cli options, config, and env variables
        defaults -- can start httpy with no options, etc. and get something
    check to make sure site root exists on filesystem
    push all config checking up and out of init
write a make file
continue with unit tests
refactor into multiple modules, distutils + make
if frame.pt is empty, then frame should just be none
handle 500 better
400 -> 501
test error templates
ignore empty error template
test last resort
put tracebacks in error messages when in development mode
figure out daemontools


========================================
    0.4 -- DYNAMIC
========================================
=====DONE=====
write html docs
support something sane like CGI to provide context.py with it's API
manage sessions, post, querystring, cookies?
logging -- stdout :-) -- but support different verbosities
factor out medusa goofiness if possible
refactor for BaseHTTPServer -- no non-std lib dependencies!
separate error for each HTTP error? if not then why Redirect sep?
500 traceback should be in pre -- hardwire this into the message?
    the problem is that we also use message for redirects, which we don't
      necessarily want in pre, but on another level it doesn't matter cause
      noone ever sees that payload
factor out templating
need to import rather than execfile
    guessing its faster
    need persistence, e.g. for template caching
        import app rather than from app import Transaction
        then app.py can run whatever and it stays in memory
add apps to configuration
guess content type in response --> NO!!!!!!11
server string -> httpy


========================================
    0.6 -- zope.server
========================================
transfer encoding
document apps
tests
make apps implicit rather than explicit
    change Config to auto-find apps by default -- can still be overriden
    also update Config tests to reflect the change
    shouldn't need to touch Server or Task since their input won't change
httpy.app.CGIMixin
supporting on-the-fly reloading of apps in dev mode
need to figure out how to sanely provide for alternate py libs
    answer: PYTHONPATH per daemontools -- configurable per site
    per-site lib
    per-app lib
    sys.path is not a simple solution since we have multiple apps -- what is the import order?
unittests!
refactor docs in Python style
remove __init__ requirement (don't always want to configure)
reconsider naming of Transaction given its meaning in persistence contexts
Transaction -> Application; persistent object
should allow any method
parse post to dict
add dev_mode to Application API
add a debug mode, which is dev mode + post-mortem
    deploy, develop, debug
raise Response(200, '') should give '', not "Request fulfilled, document follows"
raise Response(537, {}) should give '{}', not '<no output>'
ServerConfig --> Config
Exception --> StandardError
update to use zope 3.1.0 final
Task.find_app --> get_app
do we want traditional access logging? separate access and error logs?
    consider using logging from the std lib
    but maybe this just is app's job? answer: yes
app.py --> __init__.py? --> Application.py?
    __init__.py implies that the current dir is a package, which it isn't
    Application.py -- eh, too verbose :^P
on Windows, should always degrade to Server since RestartingServer won't work
signal handling
    TERM -- nice shutdown
    HUP -- reload config?
add close hook to Application
RestartingServer tries to kill a pid that isn't there
run tests on Windows again



========================================
    0.8 -- FLYNN + ACOLYTE
========================================
expose threads to configuration
move mode from env to config
do we really need to support a config file? no!
support AF_UNIX
refactor for app.py instead of __
fix to work with RestartingServer again
insert framework layer -- __/framework.py
RestartingServer should be thinner ... shouldn't instantiate Apps, e.g.
    it has to in order to know when to restart!
RestartingServer should use subprocess instead of os.spawn
add staging mode



========================================
    0.9 -- MIMEFS + PYCON
========================================
consider capturing NotImplementedError as 505 or something -- no, too much magic
DocApp?
lowercase package/module names
consider moving API up a level -- from httpy.Response import Response --> from httpy import Response
site-packages -> lib? -- no, I like site-packages since it matches stock
would be nice to make --sockfam implicit
    if address starts with a / or a ., then it is interpreted as AF_UNIX
    otherwise, AF_INET
pidfile option?
    no, because in dev you will have it in the foreground, and in dep use daemontools
config: user from env?
    no, because the only port below 1024 that you should need to bind to is 80
add config file support back in
    nope, back down to 5 options, no need
don't even need root! just cd before httpy :^)
SIGHUP -- reload config?
    nope, just restart
add mode constants for use in the wild => httpy.modes.STAGING
do something smart with mode, utils.isdeployed?
IConfig
headers should be case-preserved
consider making app logic more flexible
    app.Application.respond -> responder.Responder.respond
    should also support responder.respond
    tweak responder finding logic; integrate site-packages logic
    multiple magic directories
    multiple responders
    why is App a class but framework is a module?
consider using inspect rather than zope interfaces?
    interfaces gives us doc as well as constraint, and it's already there and working
go back to pooled thread server?
    this means re-implementing chunk transfer encoding and keep-alives
    but I don't know if these are working atm anyway
multiple frameworks? layered or either/or? -- no! too complicated; maybe later
really should have serve_py by default, no? -- no! we want to encourage responders
move response flattening out of Task into utils (for use by other couplers)
httpy.coupler to match httpy.mode? -- no! we want responders to be coupler-agnostic
need a serve_stream that starts writing before it's done reading
    not sure how to do this
    easy, just add support for Response.body as an iterator instead of a string
think about how httpy could be used in stand-alone servers/applications
    i.e., one httpy instance per installation, rather than multiple sites per httpy
