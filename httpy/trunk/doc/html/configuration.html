    <h3 class="first">Configuration</h3>

    <p>httpy exposes the following configuration options:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>apps</th>

        <td>A colon-separated list of paths that should be considered <a
        href="api.html">applications</a>. The paths should be given as if they
        were in URL-space, or from the filesystem's perspective, as if they were
        rooted in the website's filesystem root. So they should begin with a
        slash but should not include the filesystem path to the root of the
        website. The website root is always implicitly considered an
        application.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>ip</th>
        <td>The IP address that httpy should listen on. This must either be a
        valid IPv4 address or a null value, in which case httpy will listen on
        all available addresses.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>mode</th>
        <td>Either of the strings <em>deployment</em> or <em>development</em>.
        This affects various aspects of httpy's behavior.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>port</th>
        <td>The TCP port that httpy should bind to. This must be an integer
        between 0 and 65535, inclusive.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>root</th>
        <td>The path to a directory on the filesystem which will serve as the
        root of the website.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>verbosity</th>
        <td>An integer from 0 to 99, inclusive, indicating how much information
        to log.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>All of these options are, well, optional, and the defaults are as
    follows:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>apps</th>
        <td>[no applications]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>ip</th>
        <td>[listen on all addresses]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>mode</th>
        <td>deployment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>port</th>
        <td>8080</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>root</th>
        <td>. [i.e., the current working directory]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>verbosity</th>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>These defaults may be overriden in three ways: via command line options,
    through a configuration file, and by setting environment variables. This is
    also the order in which they take precedence, such that configuration file
    settings override environment variables, etc.</p>

    <p>The names of the environment variables recognized by httpy are derived by
    uppercasing the above names, and prepending them with HTTPY_. So, for
    example, to configure a server so that all instances of httpy on that server
    are run in development mode instead of deployment mode, one would simply set
    the environment variable HTTPY_MODE to "development."</p>

    <p>httpy uses the Python standard library's <a
    href="http://www.python.org/doc/lib/RawConfigParser-objects.html">RawConfigParser</a>
    class to represent its configuration file.

    This means that the file is in the style of a Windows INI file, with section
    headers in brackets, and name=value pairs on successive lines. Use the names
    as given above. The number and names of any sections are irrelevant, but
    RawConfigParser requires that there be at least one section. As an example,
    a configuration file with the following contents would set the verbosity of
    an httpy instance:</p>

    <pre>[main]
verbosity = 99</pre>

    <p>httpy uses the standard library's
    <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-optparse.html">optparse</a>
    module to represent its command line arguments.

    The names given above may be used for long-named arguments, or their initial
    letter may be used for short-named arguments. So for example, httpy could be
    started on a custom port, with a custom website root, using the following
    command:</p>

    <pre>% httpy -p9000 --root ~/www</pre>

    <p>In addition, the path to any configuration file is specified with the
    -f/--file argument.</p>
