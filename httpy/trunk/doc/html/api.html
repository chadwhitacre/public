    <h3>API</h3>

    <p>There are two kinds of websites: publications and applications. They are
    differentiated by their organization and interface models. In a publication,
    information is organized hierarchically into folders that one navigates by
    browsing. Applications, on the other hand, organize information non-
    hierarchically, and they present a search or a find interface.</p>

    <p>This documentation would be an example of a simple publication website: a
    few hypertext documents in a single folder. Gmail would be an example of a
    pure application website. Most websites, however, are hybrids. For example,
    some information might be organized hierarchically, but at points in that
    hierarchy, one may meet an application, such as a site search feature, or a
    threaded discussion forum.</p>

    <p>httpy enables you to build publication, application, and hybrid websites.
    It relies on the underlying filesystem to support a publication website's
    hierarchical organization. For application websites or sections of websites,
    httpy looks for certain Python files in a certain subdirectory of any
    directories that you <a href="configuration.html">explicitly configured as
    applications</a>. This is the <a href="#filesystem">filesystem aspect</a> of
    its API.</p>

    <p>Once your Python application has successfully made it into httpy's
    process space, then the second, <a href="#python">Pythonic aspect</a> of
    httpy's API comes into play.</p>

    <p>Both aspects are described below.</p>



    <a name="filesystem"></a>

    <h3>Filesystem API</h3>

    <p>On the filesystem, an httpy application looks like a directory for which
    the following is true:</p>

    <dl>

      <dt>It has a subdirectory named <em>__</em>.</dt>
      <dd>That's two underscores. This is the application's "magic
      directory."</dd>

      <dt>There is a Python module or package in __ named <em>app</em>.</dt>
      <dd>So there is either a file named <em>app.py</em>, or a directory named
      <em>app</em> with a file named <em>__init__.py</em>.</dd>

      <dt>The app module/package contains a class named
      <em>Transaction.</em></dt>
      <dd>This represents a single transaction within your application.</dd>

      <dt>The Transaction class's __init__ method takes a single argument.</dt>
      <dd>The value supplied will be a dictionary of configuration
      information.</dd>

      <dt>Instances of Transaction have a method named <em>process</em> that
      takes a single argument.</dt>
      <dd>Given an instance of httpy.Request, it should raise an instance of
      httpy.Response or another Exception.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>The website root is always considered to be an application, but you must
    <a href="configuration.html">explicitly configure</a> httpy to treat any
    directory below the website root as an application.</p>


    <a name="python"></a>

    <h3>Python API</h3>

    <p>As each request comes in, httpy compares the URI-path of the requested
    resource with the URI-paths of the applications it knows about. If the
    requested URI-path starts with the URI-path of an application, then the
    request is handed off to that application. If no applications are properly
    configured, then httpy uses its default application to serve the
    request.</p>


    <h4>The Transaction Object</h4>

    <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, where each request/response transaction
    happens autonomously, with no direct connection to any other transaction.
    This is what your application's Transaction object represents.</p>

    <p>Your Transaction object is instantiated once for each request to your
    application. The single argument to __init__ is a dictionary of
    configuration information, which includes the following items by
    default:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>mode</th>
        <td>Either <em>deployment</em> or <em>development</em>; inherited from
        the main httpy server configuration.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>verbosity</th>
        <td>An integer from 0 to 99, inclusive, indicating how much information
        to log; inherited from the main httpy server configuration.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>root</th>
        <td>This is the filesystem path of the application's root.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>__</th>
        <td>This is the filesystem path of the application's magic
        directory.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <p>If your application includes a module- or package-level function named
    <em>configure</em>, then this will be invoked before instantiating your
    Transaction. It will be passed the default dictionary just outlined, and it
    must return a dictionary, which will then be passed to Transaction.__init__.
    Note that <em>mode</em> and <em>verbosity</em> may be overriden from your
    <em>configure</em> function, but <em>root</em> and <em>__</em> may not.</p>

    <p>Once instantiated, httpy will pass an instance of its Request object to
    your Transaction's <em>process</em> method, which is then free to do
    whatever logic your application requires before raising an httpy.Response
    object or other Exception.</p>


    <h4>The Request Object</h4>

    <p>httpy's Request object is intended to represent an HTTP request fairly
    literally, leaving individual applications free to implement their own
    further abstraction layers. Request objects expose the following
    attributes:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" class="heading" style="padding-top: 0;">
          The Raw Request, in Whole and in Part
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>raw</th>
        <td>the raw Request as found on the wire</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>raw_line</th>
        <td>the raw Request-Line</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>raw_message</th>
        <td>the raw message</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>raw_headers</th>
        <td>the raw message headers
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>raw_body</th>
        <td>the raw message body</td>
      </tr>


      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" class="heading">
          The Request-Line
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>method</th>
        <td>the method as a string; e.g.: 'GET'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>uri</th>
        <td>a dictionary of URI parts; the result of using the standard
        library's
        <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-urlparse.html#l2h-3528">urlparse.urlsplit</a>
        on the requested URI</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>version_string</th>
        <td>the HTTP version as a string; e.g.: 'HTTP/1.1'</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th colspan="2" class="heading">
          Basic Abstractions
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>path</th>
        <td>the path part of the requested URI; e.g.: /index.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>querystring</th>
        <td>the querystring part of the requested URI; e.g.: foo=bar</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>version</th>
        <td>the HTTP version as a tuple; e.g.: (1, 1)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>message</th>
        <td>the message as an instance of the standard library's
        <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-email.Message.html">email.Message.Message</a>
        class</td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <h4>The Response Object</h4>

    <p>httpy overloads the Python <em>raise</em> statement to signal the end of an HTTP
    transaction. The Response object is the payload for this statement, carrying
    a representation of the HTTP response from your application back up into the
    httpy machinery, where it will be validated, converted to a raw HTTP
    response message, and sent back over the wire.</p>

    <p>Response.__init__ has the following three parameters:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>code</th>
        <td>the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">HTTP
        Status-Code</a> as an integer; default: 200</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>headers</th>
        <td>a dictionary of HTTP headers; default: {}</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>body</th>
        <td>the response body as a string; default: ''</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>All parameters are optional, and so you can also instantiate a Response
    without arguments, and then assign directly to attributes of the same name.
    httpy will overwrite any Content-Length header that you set, but all other
    headers (including Server) will be honored. Also, httpy will not attempt to
    guess a resource's Content-Type; your application must set it
    explicitly.</p>
