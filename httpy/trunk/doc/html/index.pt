  <p>Once you decide to build a website in Python, the next two pieces of
  technology you need to choose are:</p>

  <dl>

    <dt>1. An http server</dt>

    <dd>There are both compiled options (Apache, lighttpd), and pure-Python
    options (BaseHTTPServer, Medusa, Zserver, twisted).</dd>


    <dt>2. A request handler</dt>

    <dd>The widely available ones are those that are embedded in frameworks
    (Zope, twisted, CherryPy, Quixote, etc.). They are so embedded, in fact,
    that choosing a request handler is tantamount to choosing a framework.</dd>

  </dl>

  <p>httpy is an http server with a request handler that is tuned for serving
  dynamic websites built with Python. It attempts to hew closely to the UNIX
  ideals of simplicity, control, modularity, reliability, and sanity. What does
  this look like?</p>

  <ul>

    <li>httpy is designed for <a href="use-case.pt">a specific use-case</a>.
    </li>

    <li>httpy serves files off the filesystem. There is no object representation
    of your website tree as with the frameworks.</li>

    <li>httpy is <a href="installation.pt">easy to install</a>.</li>

    <li>httpy runs out of the box without configuration.</li>

    <li>httpy exposes <a href="configuration.pt">a sane set of configuration
    options</a>.</li>

    <li>httpy is <a href="configuration.pt">easily and flexibly configured</a>
    from the command-line, a configuration file, and/or the environment.</li>

    <li>httpy uses at most half the processes and configuration as a gateway
    solution (CGI, etc.).</li>

    <li>httpy processes are easy to get inside of and debug.</li>

    <li>httpy provides <a href="error-handling.pt">sane error handling</a>.</li>

    <li>httpy is unencumbered by complex logging, daemonization, or uid/gid
    manipulations -- functions much better handled by, e.g. <a
    href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a>.</li>

    <li>httpy provides <a href="api.pt">a sane API</a>.</li>

    <li>httpy is built on <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">http</a> and <a
    href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, two of the most rock-solid
    foundations in computing today.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>I hope you find success with httpy. I appreciate bug reports, feature
  requests, patches, compliments, complaints, etc. Please direct them to <a
  href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">chad@zetaweb.com</a>. Thank you.</p>

  <p>So what do you actually get, then?</p>

           Page Templates
           Files with a pt extension (by default; this is configurable) are
           compiled and expanded with SimpleTAL.

           Two Hooks for Page Templates
           httpy looks for a subdirectory of the publishing root named __.  If
           present, httpy looks for two files in this directory, frame.pt and
           state.py.  httpy looks for a macro named `frame' in the former; if
           found, this macro will be available to all page templates as
           `frame'.  httpy executes the latter before expanding any page tem-
           plates. The state.py script has access to the Medusa request object
           as `request' and to the SimpleTAL context object as `context'.

           Serving of Static Content
           Non-page-template files are served untouched from the filesystem.
           The "304 Not Modified" Status-Code is used when appropriate.

           Development and Deployment Modes
           Support for the "304 Not Modified" Status-Code is turned off in
           development mode. The mode can be set in the configuration file
           (see httpy.conf(5)) or in an environment variable, HTTPY_MODE. The
           configuration option overrides the environment variable.
