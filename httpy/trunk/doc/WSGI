httpy vis-a-vis. WSGI

    Python call stack           middleware stack
    request.method              environ['REQUEST_METHOD']
    raise Response()            return iter()
    self-contained site/app     several parallel apps
    simplicity                  power (throughput!)
    HTTP/1.1 support


    competitors? or is it intelligible to speak of a WSGI connector for httpy?


    Services provided by middleware belong in the call stack, not the HTTP
    stack.

    Where does the HTTP stack end and the Python call stack begin?

    WSGI
