"""This is the default framework for httpy.

An httpy framework must provide two callables: Request and Response. These can
be functions (as here), or they could be class constructors, e.g.:

    class Request:
        def __init__(self, request):
            pass

This default framework is a straight pass-through.

def Response(response):
    """Takes whatever you want, returns an httpy Response object.

    The object returned by this function will be processed by httpy's outbound
