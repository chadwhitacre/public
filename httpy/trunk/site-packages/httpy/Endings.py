"""This module contains Exception subclasses used to end httpy Transactions.

In httpy and dependent applications, the `raise' statement is overloaded
somewhat. It is used to trigger the end of a Transaction. A Transaction can end
in an error, of course, but it can also end successfully, or it can simply be
aborted. The payload that an Ending carries depends on which kind it is.

    failure
    success
    abortion

Endings include representations of all HTTP Status-Codes, as well as two
additional objects:

    Abort
