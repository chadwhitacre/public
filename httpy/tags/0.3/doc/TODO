========================================
    0.2 -- STATIC
========================================
=====DONE=====
sensible error handling
get frame macro instead of template
configuration
    think through relationship of cli options, config, and env variables
        defaults -- can start httpy with no options, etc. and get something
    check to make sure site root exists on filesystem
    push all config checking up and out of init
write a make file
continue with unit tests
refactor into multiple modules, distutils + make
if frame.pt is empty, then frame should just be none
handle 500 better
400 -> 501
test error templates
ignore empty error template
test last resort
put tracebacks in error messages when in development mode
figure out daemontools


========================================
    0.4 -- DYNAMIC
========================================
unittests!
solidify and document the API -- this will have to be backwards-compatible!
    config api
    context.py api -- CGI?
    __future__ -> app.py api -- CGI + StringIO?
convert doc to man page
write html docs
test on Windows!!!
test our processing of different cases of configuration options
figure out character encoding issues
do we want traditional access logging? separate access and error logs?
=====DONE=====
support something sane like CGI to provide context.py with it's API
manage sessions, post, querystring, cookies?
logging -- stdout :-) -- but support different verbosities
factor out medusa goofiness if possible
refactor for BaseHTTPServer -- no non-std lib dependencies!
separate error for each HTTP error? if not then why Redirect sep?
500 traceback should be in pre -- hardwire this into the message?
    the problem is that we also use message for redirects, which we don't
      necessarily want in pre, but on another level it doesn't matter cause
      noone ever sees that payload
factor out templating
need to import rather than execfile
    guessing its faster
    need persistence, e.g. for template caching
        import app rather than from app import Transaction
        then app.py can run whatever and it stays in memory
add apps to configuration
guess content type in response --> NO!!!!!!11
server string -> httpy


========================================
    0.6 -- HTTP/1.1
========================================
keep-alive
transfer encoding
range requests



========================================
    0.8 -- BELLS & WHISTLES
========================================
precompile templates (in place)
    httpy -f httpy.conf -c
support interactive features:
    ctrl-s? -- display configuration settings
    ctrl-d? -- enter postmortem debugger on next exception
add cli options to dump config and exit
httpy.app.CGIMixin
