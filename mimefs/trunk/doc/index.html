<h1>mimefs</h1>

<p>mimefs is a networked database filesystem, specified as an XMLRPC API. This
distribution includes a client library and a server implementation, both written
in Python. The server is the <i>de facto</i> definition of the mimefs API.</p>

<h2><a name="introduction" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>mimefs is a solution to the problem of information storage and retrieval, so
it sits in the same domain as the filesystem on the one hand, and RDBMSes on the
other. The genius of the Unix filesystem is that it is agnostic: interpretation
of a file's contents is referred to the application layer. The result is an
extremely flexible tool with low initial overhead in application development. On
the other hand, an RDBMS puts metadata to much better use, as well as providing
ACID-ity and a saner network abstraction, enabling richer applications.</p>

<p><b>mimefs offers the best of both worlds:</b> the powerful metadata and
robust transactions of an RDBMS, and the conventionality &mdash; in the best
sense &mdash; of a filesystem.</p>

<p>mimefs is organized into three concepts: filesystem, volume, message. A
<b>filesystem</b> is a single mimefs XMLRPC server, identified by an HTTP URI. A
<b>volume</b> is a logical container within a single filesystem, allowing
multiple client applications to share a single mimefs server. Volumes contain
MIME <b>messages</b>. Each volume and each message are identified by a UUID,
called a <b>vid</b> for volumes and a <b>mid</b> for messages.</p>

<p>The power of mimefs is that it indexes the headers in your MIME messages,
without your having to tell it about those headers ahead of time. Simply dump
whatever MIME messages you want onto your mimefs volume, and they will be
ACID-ly persisted until you retrieve them later based on their headers.</p>

<p>To whet your whistle, here is a "hello world" example using mimefslib, the
Python client:</p>

<pre>
>>> from mimefslib import Volume
>>> vid = "228434f2-885f-11da-8e59-00b0d091c186"
>>> vol = Volume("http://localhost:5370/%s" % vid)
>>> msg="""\
... Content-Type: x-my-app/foo
... x-bar: baz
...
... Greetings, program!
... """
>>> mid = vol.open(create=True)
>>> vol.write(mid, msg)
>>> mids = vol.list('x-bar = baz')
>>> mids
['f6e700b8-0aa1-4e9d-8364-a91fd0a38fdf']
>>> msg2 = vol.read(mids[0])
>>> msg == msg2
True
</pre>

<p>Notice the use of UUIDs to identify both volumes and messages. UUIDs are the
new inode. Notice also the familiar open/read/write API. mimefs tries to mimic
the traditional stdio API, while also exposing a more database-like API (store,
query).</p>


<h2><a name="installation" href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>To install the Python client, run the following in the root of this
distribution:</p>

<pre>
# python setup.py install
</pre>

<p>The mimefs server is intended to be installed much, much less often than the
client, and on a dedicated server. The relative difficulty in installation
reflects this. Before you install the server, you need the following software
installed on localhost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PostgreSQL (known to work with 8.1)</li>
  <li>Python (requires 2.4+)</li>
  <li>httpy (requires 0.8+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these are installed, run <code>make</code> in the root of this
distribution:</p>

<pre>
$ make
# make install
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no <code>configure</code> script, so you will almost
certainly have to edit <code>Makefile</code> to adapt mimefs to your system.
Also, <code>mimefsd</code> requires <code>mimefslib</code>; installing the
server will install the client as well. After installation, you will need to
start PostgreSQL, serving the database cluster created during mimefs
installation (see <code>Makefile</code>). At this point, run <code>make</code>
once more:<p>

<pre># make init</pre>

<p>This will create a new mimefs database in the PostgreSQL cluster being served
on localhost. And with that, you can now run <code>mimefsd</code> to start the
server. The convention is to serve mimefs on TCP port 5370. To depart from this
convention, please consult the <code>mimefsd</code> manual page.</p>

<p>We recommend using daemontools to manage your <code>mimefsd</code> and
<code>postmaster</code> processes. Our practice is to create service directories
named <code>mimefsd</code> and <code>postmaster</code> under
<code>/usr/local/service</code>, each with a <code>log</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>mimefs version 0 is known to work with FreeBSD 4.11.</p>
